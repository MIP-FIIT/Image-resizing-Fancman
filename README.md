## Image Uploading and Resizing app

This apps main functionality is uploading and resizing images on the server and saving image details on to MYSQL server to user data. We are using PHP, Javascript, HTML and SQL.
From Jquery library we are going to use function called Ajax, which will provide us uploading and resizing image without refreshing the page. I used code from site [Link](https://www.9lessons.info/2014/07/ajax-upload-and-resize-image-with-php.html)

## Requirements

This app is using jQuery and its plugin called jQuery.form.js. Both scripts will save us time and codeing space.

## Refactoring process

Fixed code syntax and formatting, added functions to save space and time. Also added function which create users table and fill it. And lastly I changed mysqli method to PDO which is safer.
