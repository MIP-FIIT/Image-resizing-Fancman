## Image Uploading and Resizing app

This apps main functionality is uploading and resizing images on the server and saving image details on to MYSQL server. We are using PHP, Javascript, HTML and SQL.
From Jquery library we are going to use function called Ajax, which will provide us uploading and resizing image without refreshing the page.

## Requirements

This app is using jQuery and its plugin called jQuery.form.js. Both scripts will save us time and codeing space.
